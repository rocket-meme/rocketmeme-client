# üöÄ RocketMeme Trading API

A Solana-based trading API for Raydium and pumpFun meme coins, integrating **persistent-stream** and **standard-request** modules to execute transactions through RocketMeme.io API.

---

## üìå Overview

Have a trading strategy or want to build your own bot? Our **[API](https://rocketmeme.io/)** handles transactions, so you can focus on strategy and execution. We offers two execution approaches:

1. **Persistent Stream (persistent-stream)**:

   - Maintains a persistent **HTTP/2** connection to RocketMeme's API.
   - Uses **Unix sockets** or **Windows named pipes** for efficient inter-process communication.
   - Best suited for **high-frequency** trading.
   - Recommended for ultra-low latency

2. **Standard Request (standard-request)**:

   - Makes individual **HTTP POST requests** for each trade.
   - Simpler to use but has a slight overhead due to HTTP session initialization.

üí° **Alternative Execution Method:** You can also execute your trades seamlessly through our **[RocketMeme Web App](https://app.rocketmeme.io/)**, providing a user-friendly and efficient way to trade directly from your browser. For more details, refer to our **[Web App Documentation](https://rocketmeme.io/docs)**.

## üìä Differences Between persistent-stream & standard-request

| Feature              | Persistent Stream (persistent-stream) | Standard Request (standard-request)   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Connection Type**  | Persistent **HTTP/2 + Socket**          | Simple **HTTP Request**                 |
| **Latency**          | Lower latency (pre-established)         | Slightly higher (new request each time) |
| **Use Case**         | High-frequency, automated trading       | Low-frequency, manual trading           |
| **Error Handling**   | Handles API downtime efficiently        | New request needed if API fails         |
| **System Resources** | Uses more RAM (persistent socket)       | Lightweight, stateless requests         |

## üöÄ How to Execute

#### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
sh
git clone https://github.com/rocket-meme/rocketmeme-client.git
cd rocketmeme-client
npm install


### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Persistent Stream (Long-Lived Connection)

The persistent-stream module establishes a **long-lived** connection and efficiently handles transactions.

#### **Step 2: Start the Persistent Connection**
sh
node persistent-stream/utils/rocketmeme-persistent-connection.js --server https://trade.rocketmeme.io


- This connects to RocketMeme's trading server and listens for requests.

#### **Step 3: [Update your configurations](#Ô∏è-configuration-parameters)**
sh
node persistent-stream/persistent-client.js


- This sends a trade request using the **persistent socket**.
- Best for **ultra-low latency** trading.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Standard Request (One-Time Execution)

The standard-request module makes a **single HTTP request per transaction**.

#### **[Update your configurations](#Ô∏è-configuration-parameters)**
sh
node standard-request/standard-client.js


- No need to establish a persistent connection.
